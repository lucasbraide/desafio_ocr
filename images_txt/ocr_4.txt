Abstract: This paper focuses on the contribution of mega events onto the development of a
green economy at the event host location and discusses how to measure it. The promises of
organizers usually are very ambitious but the question remains as to how realistic these
claims are. This question will be addressed in three sections by using methods that are
primarily analytical and critical rather than an empirícal collection of data. The
environmental sustainability of mega sport events is discussed and then a framework is
developed to capture the green legacy and the basis for building up a green economy in all
its dimensions. The main contribution mega events can make to developing a green
economy at the host city will be explained. Furihermore, the paper seeks to explain why
promises made during the bidding process on the environmental sustainability are often not
met when it comes to the preparation for the event. The current obstacies to producing
“Green Games” and building up a green economy are presented entightened, ranging from
financial shorticomings to a lack of serious environmental interest on the part of the
organizers, Tn conclusion, it will be shown that mega events encourage the development of
a green economy by their signaling power and educational opportuníties.
